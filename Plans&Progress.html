        <h2> Detailed Description</h2> 
		<h3> Plans &amp; Progress </h3> 
        <p> 
            Around April of 2020, Jenny asked us to form a group for a group assignment for the course Introduction to Information Technology. She reached out to Chamal and Momitha through Instagram and Jeremy through Facebook. Once they were all on board, Jeremy invited Corey to join the team too, however shortly after, Corey had decided to drop the class. During the first class where the assignment was talked about, Steven had asked to join the team on MS Teams, and he came onboard as well. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At the start of Assignment 2 meetings were going underway immediately, the day right after confirming the group, we decided to put forward our ideas of what sort of project we wanted to do. The different ideas that the group had included a PTV Chatbot, an app that keeps track of your grocery and their expiry dates, a ‘what’s in your fridge?’ app to provide recipes with the ingredients you already have and a clothing app about your virtual body where you can add branded clothes to it. The team then put together polls on Microsoft Teams to decide on which project to take on. The results from this poll were almost unanimous as most of us chose to do the ‘Expiration Date app’. From here our team held a meeting to go over how we wanted to go about the task and how to get it done together. We all collectively agreed that Google Docs was an essential service that we would need to work together. We scheduled meeting times during our MS Teams calls to make sure that we were ready for every next task.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With a slow but steady start, our group managed to work together productively to help each other finish all of the required tasks. In assignment 2, Jeremy had brought in his mum to help us with our task of ‘Interviewing an IT Professional’. She was of great help to show us an insight of how a workforce works in the IT industry. As she is a Senior in her role, she provided us with detailed answers which we were able to clearly understand the different roles in which there is in the IT industry.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At some points our group had run into difficulties in regards to our project idea, ‘Is it realistic enough? Can this actually be pulled off?’ we asked ourselves. With the big scale idea we had of having a scanner be able to be implemented into a fridge or a pantry to see what foods were there, it was hard to justify as to how it would work. Often we have leftovers in our fridge that don’t have an ‘expiry date’, it would not make sense to have this device if it can’t register all the different foods in our storage spaces. Coming from different backgrounds, we all could agree that there will always be some sort of food in our fridge/pantry that we wouldn’t be able to describe in English, let alone be able to find the details of it in any database that we could get access to, if we could get access to one in the first place.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The group then pivoted and brought the idea up to Dr B about how we could go about it. The group had come together to decide that the best call for action would be to simplify the project overall. The project has now become similar to a to-do list but specifically for groceries. Being able to input data about the groceries that are in your fridge, taking photos, setting the expiry date are all part of the intended design. The difference from this being a huge to-do list and an entirely different app, is that it is designed to be able to be accessed easily on any mobile device that can connect to the cloud. It also serves as a reminder to let you know when a product would be expiring soon to let you know to buy more, or to do something with the product. For simple products such as milk, it has a set expiry date on the front of the carton, easy to see. However, we all get forgetful at times and rather than just putting the product into your phone’s memos, having an app remind you to serve as a grocery assistant. This also helps in case you plan to go grocery shopping two days in a week and don’t remember if you had bought milk yet or not, the user would be able to see in their inventory that they had already bought milk and it will not be going off any time soon.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When approaching the assignment itself, we all put in our ideas into each section. Some with more experience than others in particular sections, allowed us to work efficiently together to get the work done in a reasonable amount of time. Where someone was more experienced, was a mentor/leader to someone who hadn’t touched it. By learning together, it had brought the team together to be more supportive of each other.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With hard work and long hours, our project has been able to be completed in the given time frame. By being there for each other when times got rough, we managed to pull through together.
