        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Topic:</h3>
        <p> The present project comprises an application that accurately maintains one’s food inventory by alarming the user anticipated expiration date wastage. It coordinates with the user's inventory planning on what plans/dinners can be prepared to both maintain a steady food supply and control food wastage in a household which in the long run makes a difference within the country's landfill. </p>

        <p>
          The expiry date names in food items contain prefixes, for example, "expiry," "sell by," "best previously," "use by" and so on. Consumers sometimes misinterpret these names and dispose of food once the date is passed as they mistakenly presume the date is an indicator of safety, however, for most foods the date is the manufacturer’s best guess of how long the product will be at its very best quality. Subsequently, regulating date labelling is the most effective solution for decreasing food waste, and could spare huge amounts of food that is squandered every year. In this proposed project, the expiry dates of the food items will be manually entered by the user and are arranged into categories. Notifying the users allows them to keep track of their inventory where they can buy and eat accordingly. By using the application, the customers can more readily oversee what things to cook or consume, and furthermore when the products need to be purchased again. </p>

        <p> One of the possible outcomes of this project would be managing the food items expenditure by enabling a user to buy fewer food items and to buy only the food items needed, and making it easier to create a meal at home rather than going to a restaurant or ordering hot meals for delivery, thus avoids food spoilage and saves money to a certain extent. Secondly, Consuming expired food may trigger food poisoning causing symptoms such as fever, cramping in the stomach area, dizziness, and dehydration. Some food stored past its use-by date in poor conditions can even become contaminated with serious bacterial infections, moulds, and mycotoxins. The application will inform when the food is on the brink of expiring and when it is unhealthy to eat, ensuring better health for the individual. Furthermore, Taste of some foods may degrade when they reach near the expiry date. The automated notifications will alert the consumer several days before the expiry date, so the food is consumed when it has the best taste. </p>


        <p> Overall, this app will draw attention to educating consumers regarding the standard and safety of food products. With reminders and shopping records, the consumers will have the option to buy progressively proper amounts, as opposed to purchasing immense amounts that may turn bad.
        </p>

        <h3> Motivation: </h3>
        <p>Our main motivation behind this project is to make organising and prioritising of food for individuals and families easier by helping them keep track of their expiration dates of food stored in the kitchen. In crucial times like this where there is a pandemic happening and a shortage of food at the local supermarket, it is important for everyone to keep track of what they have in their kitchen and to not waste anything they have.</p>


        <h3> Landscape: </h3>
        <p>Similar applications include "NoWaste" and “Fridgely” and they follow a relative aim which is to reduce food waste in households. The latest version of these applications is improved and offers beneficial features. Especially NoWaste - an iOS app which allows users to scan barcodes of their shopping receipts to add food into their inventory – for freezer, fridge and pantry. Enables the user to synchronize their lists across devices and provides easy video tutorials matching with current inventory stock. Moreover, it provides the user to track their monthly food waste savings as well as educates their users about foods that hold a high-risk.
