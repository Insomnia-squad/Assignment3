        <h2> Detailed Description </h2> 
		<h3> Risks </h3>
        <p> 
            Our project is mainly focused on the software side as we are developing a mobile application and with that will come some potential risks. However since most of the risks are more onto the technical side, we will only be listing the technical riskThe risks of our mobile application ‘Fade’ are:
        </p>
        
         <a class="risksub">Privacy: </a>
        <p>
            Our application will be free on the mobile app store, however maintaining the app will cost time and money and we will have no other option but to run advertisements on our platform. Though in the modern age of online advertisement, there is a feature within the advertising services that tailor advertisement to the user’s prior activities, meaning that it tracks and collects data from the user, even sometimes without them knowing. This will be a serious privacy issue for the users as we want all of our users to use our application without the worry of being secretly tracked and watched by an external source.
        </p>
        
            <a class="risksub">Refrigerator Radiation: </a>
        <p>
            One of the risks that users may find is that the camera from their mobile phones would be constantly scanning their food, and this could be concerning as they will be closer to their refrigerator in the kitchen. This is concerning because refrigerators emit electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Though it is true that refrigerators emit very low EMR therefore proving little to no harm, however there is still a potential safety hazard risk where the refrigerator may malfunction.

        </p>
        
            <a class="risksub">Data breach &amp; leaks: </a>
        <p>
            Since we will be implementing universal access of profile accounts across many devices, we will need to have a database setup where data can be retrieved and stored into. However, we will also be adding new data related security risks by adding this feature. Though this ‘risk’ is defined as having an unauthorised user gain access to personal data of many users on our platform; whether that may be done through hacking, or security flaws and glitches within our system.
        </p>
        
            <a class="risksub">Difficulty during development: </a>
        <p>
            We are relatively new to the industry of Information Technology and to mobile app development. Therefore, we will meet potential software difficulties during the development that we might not know as of right now. This difficulty may be that the software used to develop proves to be more difficult to learn than we expected. If that were to ever be the case, the app may face a lot of glitches, security flaws or not facilitate some features.
