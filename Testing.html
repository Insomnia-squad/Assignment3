		<h3> Testing </h3> 
        <p> 
            Tests will gather information about the functionality and user experience of the app. While it is vital that the app functions as intended, it is also important to consider providing the user with a seamless experience. We should begin by focusing on the functionality of the app as the testings will help confirm that the app is fulfilling its intended purpose. We could have a few testers experiment with our app at an early state for a set amount of time and report their experiences at the end. It will provide us the opportunity to receive genuine feedback and potentially new ideas to implement into our app whilst in development. Our testers should also reflect the background of our target audience. Our target audience are mainly adults who may already have many different types of foods stocked in their fridge. They may be looking for a method to save money over a long period of time or simply a way to make good use of whatever leftover foods they have. As the app progresses, it could be worthwhile to have the app tested also based on user experience to ensure an overall pleasant feel.
