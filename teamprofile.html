			<p class="big"> Hello! My name is Jeremy Ng Kwik Tung. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number is s3842858.
				I was born in Mauritius but came here to Australia in 2011 to get better access to education and to have a better life.
				I can also speak three languages which are French, English and Creole. For my hobbies, I love travelling, learning new things and playing video games.
				<br><br>As of right now, I do not have a specific interest in Information Technology but I have some interest in programming.
				As for my IT experience, I have a bit of experience in game design and programming, though I am a beginner in both
				sides. In terms of programming language, I have used Java, Visual Basic and Python before but I still have a lot more to learn.<br>
			</p>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chamal</h3>
			<IMG style="WIDTH:138pt;" SRC="chamal.jpeg" align="center">
			<p class="big"> Hi there! My name is Domingu Vithange Chamal Adithya Paulis, but I mainly use Chamal as my first name.
				I was born and raised in Sri Lanka. I moved to Melbourne at the start of 2020 to do my Bachelor of Information Technology at
				RMIT. I am proficient in Sinhalese (my mother tongue) as well as English. My hobbies include playing video games, baking, watching anime and strumming on my ukulele.
				<br><br> I have a big interest in game development and cybersecurity. I have been interacting with computers from a young age, so I grew quite an interest in technology as a whole. I have done various IT courses such as learning java, python
				and HTML. However, I am not a professional in any of these languages.<br>
			</p>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Jenny</h3>
			<IMG style="WIDTH:140pt;" SRC="jenny.jpeg" class="center">
			<p class="big">Hi! my name is Jenny Nguyen (pronounced 'new wen'), s3838780, I am a first-year student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.
				My parents are from Vietnam however I was born here in Australia. My hobbies include watching too much kdrama/anime and playing Animal Crossing when I'm not meant to.
				<br><br>My interest in IT stems from an interest in gaming and with new technology helping people every day. The IT experience I have includes
				taking Information Technology as an elective during years 9-10, where I learnt to make flash games. I was also undertaking Computing and Informatics during VCE.
				I have worked in Microsoft Access, Visual Basic and created websites during these
				years. When it comes to programming, I have used HTML, CSS and Java, though I am a newbie to all of these.<br>
			</p>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Steven</h3>
			<IMG style="WIDTH:145pt;" SRC="steven.jpeg" class="center">
			<p class="big">Hello, I am Steven. Both my parents are from Vietnam but was I born here in Melbourne. I enjoy relaxing and listening to music in my spare time.
				Occasionally, I talk to my friends online and play games with them.<br><br> My interest in IT began through observing and interacting with the IT department at my high school. Whenever my teachers and I had technical problems with our
				devices, we would contact the IT department to help troubleshoot our problems.
				I found that when looking around their workplace, there would always be complex-looking machines that would make me curious in their work.
				I have only a little bit of experience in Java, AWS, and HTML so I still have a lot to learn<br>
			</p>


			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Momitha</h3>
			<IMG style="WIDTH:145pt; HEIGHT: 165pt" SRC="momitha.jpeg" class="center">
			<p class="big"> Hello, I am originally from India but moved to New Zealand when I was 13 years old. I finished high school in 2019 at Westlake Girls High School, NZ. I am a trilingual for now.
				I speak Telugu, Hindi and English.
				I started learning French online purely out of boredom from speaking native languages. I dance and have a love affair with my camera as well.
				My father took the responsibility of educating me in every aspect of life possible and therefore enlightened me about the future of IT. I always see a spark in his eyes when he speaks about technology and innovation. This grew on me strongly
				and decided to walk his path.
				<br><br>Fast forward to 3 years, I gained a job in high school as a ‘tech Wizard’ where I help students to make their digital lives better and error-free. My time spent there was extremely precious since I have developed knowledge in dealing
				with people and their server/password/printer issues. Also, reading tech magazines was such a thrill.
				Anyway, I truly found that innovation changes the world by making it an increasingly edified spot to live. What's great, it makes self-instruction simpler, one can take in anything from anyplace.
				I cannot wait to learn and explore my time at RMIT.<br>
			</p>


			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Group Processes</h1>
			<p class="big"> Due to the online nature of the group, everyone had to deal with online communication rather than face to face or getting everyone in one room at the same time. Reflecting on assignment 2, we were able to begin on time and not
				waste any time during the earlier stages of the assessment. This demonstrated good communication between the group members which is shown to persist through the regular use of Microsoft Teams. We were able to distribute the work without any
				issues and build on top of each other's ideas. We were also able to effectively split the responsibilities when using GitHub and all contribute to the repository. We felt comfortable depending on each other when needed and often communicated
				even outside of scheduled meetings as a group. However, we did more work when approaching towards the end of the assignment, and failed to put up any drafts or update along the way until the assignment which decreased our consistency. In
				Terms of introducing changes for this assignment, we planned to have shorter valuable meetings. Then, try and achieve the goals set for every meeting and finally, aim for a more spread workload as opposed to doing all near the due date of the
				assignment.

			<h1 style= "text-align: center;">Career Plans</h1>
	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Jeremy</h3>
	<p class="big">As of now, I do not have an ideal job that I want to aim solely towards but when scrolling through the job advertisements, I found that I am interested in being a software engineer.
	What interests me for this job position is the salary but also the key responsibilities where you have to work with other departments of the company to find both business and technical solutions to problems.
	You would also be building new software, learning new things and teaching others which I enjoy doing.</P>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chamal</h3>
		<p class="big">
I don’t have an ideal job I’m pursuing at the moment. However, I want to work both in the professional and academic fields in IT.
I’d like to start my career as an entry level programmer, presumably developing an utility application.
Then I would like to work in cyber-security. Perhaps as a cyber security consultant.

		</p>
			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Jenny</h3>
			<p class="big">
				My ideal job is a job in I.T. There isn't a particular job out there that I want to do as of right now, but I do know that I want to head towards artificial intelligence and cyber security,
				probably as either a systems/software engineer.
				After completing my bachelor course, I would like to undertake an undergrad program into a job that I like, I wouldn’t mind if it were overseas.
				Part of the reason is because I know that it will be a safe investment on my future to head that way, but a bigger part is my interest in it.
				I have always been fascinated with the idea of working with AI, everything is so new and impressive.
				Many people fear what AI can be, but to me I think it is something worth delving deeply into, to find out more about it. AI can help the future grow and help us advance further than we have ever yet. With this, I would like to be part of a team where I can help develop new technologies and create a secure product for the public.

				<h3 style="text-align: center;">Steven</h3>
				<p class="big">
					I have yet to have a clear depiction of what I consider an ideal job. Though, in the long run, I would say that I’d be interested in working with a team. I enjoy having to interact with other people in order to work towards a goal.
					And rather than doing things by myself, working alongside others will support me in honing and expanding my knowledge and skills. I imagine myself hopefully working with bright and like-minded inpiduals within a company will integrity and righteous values.
				 	When scrolling through job advertisements, one thing that piqued my interest was a web development job that required working with others.
					However, I realise that I may need some experience beforehand. Perhaps an internship or undergrad program will help in gaining experience.
				</p>
					<h3 style="text-align: center;">Momitha</h3>
					<p class="big">
					I am seeking to turn into a data scientist after my undergrad.
					The most fascinating thing about Data science is it feels like a factual investigation. Having the option to acquire, procedure, and manufacture models out of information,
					which will eventually be utilized for their prescient abilities - be it for human services, targeted advertising, Advanced AI /Augmented reality – it's energizing in my view.
					By investigating, obtaining and assorting raw data helps improve how people settle on choices and how calculations upgrade results.
					I think it's fascinating to be able to build models that enhance the existing models and create the best UI experiences.
					The overall makeup of the job advert is incredibly attractive as they straight-forwardly mention what they require of you.
					No unnecessary wishes. The tasks they have mentioned, such as “predict the future performance of tasks, users, and products.
					Quality assessment of ML models and fraud detection”. This is the work that I want to be doing after 5 years.
