        <h2> Detailed Description</h2>
		<h3> Group Processes &amp; Communications </h3>
        <p> 
            Communication within our group is fundamental, we hold 2 meetings weekly where we talk about our goals and tasks that need to be fulfilled this meeting and by the next meeting also. Without having the communication between us, it ultimately makes it difficult to produce a project that would be up to standard. As we all share similar classes, we are able to bond over the difficulties that we have during this pandemic and the stress of the new uni student life. This helps us connect on a more personal level rather than just a working day to day level. By being able to be comfortable in having conversations with each other, it made it easier for us to discuss our work and any topics we were having troubles with. Most of our communication has been over MS Teams or Google Docs. By having these resources readily available to us, we are able to work together as a team more efficiently.
