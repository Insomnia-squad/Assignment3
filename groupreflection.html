		<h3>Chamal</h3>
		<p> I was lucky to be able to work with such a group of hardworking people. When we first got together we barely knew each other but after
			working together for several months it was clear that we were a dream team. We were lucky to not have any slackers and all of us even put
			more than enough effort to make the project better. Jeremy and Jenny were extremely good in their html development skills which helped the rest of us a tonne.
			Momitha was a born researcher and made points that were very intellectual. Steven, being pressured by a job didn’t cut any corners in his work either.
			No one complained about having meetings or even missed any meetings. Everyone was very responsive outside meetings when we communicated through our instagram group.
			Ultimately, it is clear that this team’s good work reflects on the teamwork and effort that all of us put in.

		</p>

		<h3>Jenny</h3>
		<p> Insomnia Squad started out as just a group of students who had barely met each other at uni. With the difficulties of online learning and commitment,
			this group has been able to produce work at a high calibre with support from one another. Although all of our daily lives are completely different,
			we managed to hold regular meetings and worked proficiently through each task. With few problems,
			the team managed to make decisions ultimately which really helped us going. Being in this group has taught me that a team really has to support each other to get work done.
			Being supportive of each other makes the environment much more pleasant and allows work to be done more efficiently and to a higher standard.
			Supportive team members make it more motivating to want to get work done at a high standard, if I had not had such kind members, I don’t think I would have produced work at the same standard.
		</p>
	<h3>Jeremy</h3>
	<p> At the very beginning, we did not know each other very well however we made an online chat to get to know each other better.
		At first, I was expecting that this would be another group project where the work would be slow, and that tasks would be difficult to be set amongst each other.
		Fortunately, that was not the case and each of the team members worked very hard to partake in the assignment.
		The team members and I communicated very well altogether, in fact sometimes we help and assist each other for the other courses we each do during uni.
		I was surprised on how the tasks were done quickly and how we recovered from issues quickly. Out of all the groups I have been in before,
		this was one of the best groups I have ever been in and this group taught me that being in a group with very hard-working supportive members, work and tasks are done faster and much easily.
		Though, in a group we tend to finalise and bring everything together at the very nearing end of the assignment.
		Our Git log activity proved that most commits were done during the very last week of the assignments.
		Perhaps, next time it would be best for us to spread the workload across the weeks so that we do not have to push everything at the very end.
	</p>


	<h3>Momitha</h3>
	<p>
		As a group, we all have clear thoughts on what we are supposed to do, and no one is hesitant to clarify any doubts.
		Despite the online nature of this assignment, we assigned each other tasks and tried to complete them within a reasonable timeframe, communication was
		improved during our meetings which helped to keep us on track and held shorter meeting times. Next time, ensuring we follow our agendas to the core and
		goals every meeting and proofreading each other’s work to maintain consistency. It was surprising just how quickly we assembled ourselves together to get this project
		done quickly and our team's ability to overcome minor issues was extremely helpful and made the project run smoothly and also everyone seemed to have a good attitude
		and was ready to get to work and we just managed to finish the assignment with our contributions together towards the end of the assignments despite, the hectic time frame.
		This team really showed me that having a group who are behind each other and committed to everyone getting good results, there is significantly less pressure on you as an individual.
		Our GitHub log of activity was not updated regularly, and unfortunately most of the commits were pushed approaching to the end of the assignment.
		Certainly, GitHub reflects our groups work activity quite well as we can see through this by pulling the file and looking at what was done, and we could see what needed to be done.
	</p>

	<h3>Steven</h3>
	<p> As a group, we functioned extremely well together – excelling in communication especially. We very often exchanged and built on top of each other’s
		thoughts and ideas which lead to a reasonably pleasant website. Unlike during the previous assignment, we became more familiar and open with each other
		which boosted our efficiency. This is made apparent through our shorter and more concise team meetings. Previously, we would sometimes reach almost an hour
		and a half. However, throughout this assignment we have consistently reached meetings that last for 20-30 minutes. We would also regularly communicate with
		 each other outside of Microsoft Teams through an Instagram group chat whenever there was something important that needed to be discussed.
		 In hindsight, the use of the Instagram group chat was a very effective means of communication. Most of us were already accustomed to the app and
		 the push notifications seemed to be a lot more consistent when trying to get the attention of fellow group members compared to Microsoft Teams.
