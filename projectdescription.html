        <h2> Project Description</h2>
        <h3> What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely able to be done soon? What technological or other developments make this possible?
        </h3>
        <p class="para">
            The Fade app will be available on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS. Users will need to use the camera within the app on their mobile devices. That camera will act as a scanner which would recognise the food product, and the app will record all the details of such food products scanned by the user. However if the user is unable to scan the food product, a manual input by typing from the user will be required. Nevertheless, the app will then display all the food products that are in stock or near to expiration if the user input is successful.</p>

        <p class="para">
            To make it straightforward for the users, the food items will be labelled with a green icon if there’s enough time to safely consume the food. The items that are soon to expire, as in less than two days to expiration, will be labelled with yellow and the items that have passed the expiration date will be labelled in red. Fade will check the ingredients the user currently owns and will be recommending recipes from a database of pre-entered recipes. For example, if the user gets a notification saying bananas are close to expiration, they will be notified of a recommended recipe such as ripe bananas.</p>
        <p class="para">
            The app will also offer other minor functionalities such as; recommending what to be purchased by the user based on purchase history; offer coupons and discount suggestions; and offer continuity across different devices where all are connected under the same account, as this will be particularly helpful for families or people in large groups. To increase the accuracy on calculating the expiration date of food products handled in fridges and freeze, Fade will be offering a product that's sold separately, a gadget that the consumer must attach to a convenient place such as their fridge or pantry. This device is made up of a screen and small camera which acts as a scanner and is activated when a unique code on the device is entered into the app.</p>
        <p class="para">
            As development on the app continues, it is expected within the next three years that the app will become more efficient and effective at detecting foods and their expiration dates with great consistency. The ability to also track other miscellaneous items such as drinks will most likely be offered to users, as well a considerably larger and more flexible pool of recipes can be expected. Given that the app we create is reliable, consistent, and effective, businesses such as restaurants may find themselves incorporating our service into their procedures to become more environmentally friendly by replacing stickers and papers to record prep dates/use by dates for foods. We may potentially also consider designing custom fridges and freezers to coexist and optimize the functions of our app.
        </p>


        <h3>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or
            Technologies?
        </h3>
        <p class="para">
            The app intends to make a positive impact on society and the environment by encouraging a useful life skill that allows them to create food for themselves or others and reduce overall food wastage.</p>
        <p class="para">
            Since the app is able to recognise commonly bought items, the app is also intended to have the function to search for and offer coupons and discounts while the user is grocery shopping. For those on a tight budget or are simply frugal, this feature can help immensely when trying to save a large amount of money over a long period of time whilst developing towards a healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p class="para">
            Considering how the app will affect the job market, it has the potential to spawn a demand for custom made fridges at an affordable price that can better support the app’s features. People who often cook or are planning to can also find great value in using this app. This is especially true for people who want to have their foods all organised and easy to mentally process. By being notified of soon to be expired food, it allows the user to act upon it before being most likely forced to throw it away therefore losing money and value while contributing to food wastage. Overall, the app does well to promote good organisation of foods and responsible actions in regards to wastage. </p>


        <h3>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
        <p class="para">
            The app elicits a healthy and balanced lifestyle by encouraging the user to keep track of their ingredients and by offering recipes to create at home. People can often find themselves resorting to ordering delivery or going outside to eat, spending large amounts of money over a long period of time. However, the app may motivate users to learn how to prepare their food through provided recipes. Thus, the app may become the catalyst for many people learning a new skill that could potentially benefit the multitude of people around them such as family and friends.</p>
        <p class="para">
            For some people, it even has the potential to lead them towards something greater such as a new passion that results in a career where they can ultimately help people and society. The app could also be used as a recreational activity when wanting to cook something. Since all you need to do is scan the food to be presented with many different types of recipes, the app can come in handy when unsure on what to exactly make. The user can be potentially introduced to new types of ways to prepare a certain food and can provide an extremely educational experience.</p>
        <p class="para">
            Since one of the main reasons for household food waste is fresh produce left unattended in the freezer or fridge and people not completing their meals, the app will also help minimise food wastage and better improve the environment by reducing CO2 production.
