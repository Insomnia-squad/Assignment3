		<h3> Roles </h3> 
        <p>
            In this project, the technical roles required include those who are experienced in building apps and designing interfaces. With the assignment, our group did not have any specific roles assigned to us, however we all filled in different roles when needed. When a conversation had started to go quiet in a meeting, often one of us would step up and start asking the group what we wanted to work on next and how we would go about it. This helped the group immensely as if we did not have someone take leadership, we would not have gotten anywhere clearly. Initially we had Jeremy working on the template for the HTML and CSS files, but then Jenny wanted to have a go at redo-ing them. With this, comments were added to the files to help others also understand the code clearly and follow along.
