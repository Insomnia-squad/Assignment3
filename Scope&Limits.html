        <p> 
            Time and level of expertise was the biggest limiter to this project, it would take a long time to develop the technology needed to execute this product. Having a database for products is a good start, however there are products from all across the world that would need to be inputted into this data in order for the product to work at its full potential. Another problem is that often people will buy random products, random meaning that it is not from a particular store, e.g. a market, and there is no particular database that would necessarily hold all of these products. There would also be the issue of getting databases from all over the world to be able to accommodate for each product, which would not seem to be able to be done right now. By designing the product so that it gives users the freedom to input their own groceries, it allows more people to use it freely.
