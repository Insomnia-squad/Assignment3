        <h4>
            The timeframe of this project has been allocated 4 weeks. Within these 4 weeks, us university students who are very new to programming would not be able to create such a product that could be almost considered revolutionary. Projects like this would take possibly years to create and perfect. There would always be concerns about the risks that the project could create.Together we decided to move our project to something that is a lot more simple to understand which seemed like the more realistic idea.
