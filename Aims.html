        <h2> Detailed Description</h2> 
		<h3> Aims </h3> 
        <p> 
            The aim of the project is to create a product to help out those that buy groceries. With the use of this product, it can minimise the amount of waste that comes from overbuying. The product can also assist in letting users know what their fridge/pantry has, that is about to expire, this gives them some time to think of a use for these foods before having to toss it.
There was a ‘big-picture’ aim for our project as well,  Food wastage is a problem that not many people think about or keep in mind when they go out and buy groceries, however it has several negative impacts on society as well as our environment. According to Global Food Waste and its Environmental Impact | Green Living, 2020, the carbon footprint of food wastage is the equivalent of 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 s 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year.Another aim for this project is to understand what it takes to put together a large scale project and how to work together as a team to better our future. Working together as a team is crucial in any successful business, it doesn’t change whether it is at university or in a workplace. This assignment lets us see this as we have to work together to create a website to showcase our project design, but also research on the necessary things to put together such a product.
